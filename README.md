## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap Containers v5.2
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project , I learned about containers layout design , padding , and customization for bootstrap framework contents.By using the container , we can easily create the responsive layouts, but we need to adjust carefully for  the width of the content based on the respective screen size.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap container](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/containers/) - This helped me to learn about Bootstrap container, row and column.
- [Bootstrap spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/spacing/) - This helped me to learn more about margin , padding and gap utility to modify specific content's appearance.
